# Logging in Java

## 1. What is Logging?

Logging is the process of recording events, messages, or other information during the execution of a program. Logs are typically used to track the flow of the program, capture errors, and provide insights into the application's behavior.

## 2. Why Logging is Important

Logging is crucial for several reasons:
- **Debugging**: Helps in identifying and fixing issues by providing detailed information about the application's execution.
- **Monitoring**: Allows you to monitor the health and performance of your application in real-time.
- **Auditing**: Provides a historical record of events for audit purposes.
- **Maintenance**: Facilitates the maintenance of the application by providing insights into its behavior over time.

## 3. Understanding Logging Levels

Logging levels indicate the severity or importance of the messages being logged. Common logging levels include:
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for diagnosing problems. Typically used during development.
- **INFO**: Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.
- **WARN**: Potentially harmful situations that are not yet errors.
- **ERROR**: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
- **FATAL**: Severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
